        "logo_description": "The CMR University logo is inspired by that of the CMR Jnanadhara Trust, the University\u2019s promoting body. The logo depicts a beautiful swan that is just about to take off from the waters, one that is reaching for the skies.The swan is the carrier of Goddess Saraswathi \u2013 the Goddess of Learning.\nIt is said that the Swan with its sensitive beak has the power of discrimination \u2013 an ability to distinguish pure milk from a mixture of milk and water. The swan thus symbolizes discrimination between right and wrong, good and evil or the eternal and the transient. It is this ability to acquire and apply knowledge in a discerning manner, for the overall good of mankind, which closely aligns with the University\u2019s ethos.\nRooted in Indian tradition, this contemporary form of the Hamsa, the Swan wholly embodies the vision of CMR University.",
